## Blackjack Project

### Overview
Deal two hands of cards - one to a Dealer and another to a Player. Allow the players to Hit (add cards to their hand) or Stay (not add cards to their hand) in accordance to the rules of blackjack
The Dealer's decisions are based on game logic in the program.
The Dealer must decide to Hit or Stay based on the rules of Blackjack: if the Dealer's hand total is below 17, the Dealer must Hit; if the hand total is 17 or above, the Dealer must Stay.

### How to Use
Run the program. Your cards will be displayed along with one of the dealer cards. The program will check you for Blackjack and display winner appropriately. You will be provided option to hit or stay, enter H or S. When you stay the dealer will play until 17 or above. Then the winner will be displayed. After the game you will be asked if you want to play again. enter Y or N.

### Technologies
- Used OO design
- recursive methods
- Enumerated Types

### Lessons Learned
While I had good notes and comments to build out the logic of my program, I failed to properly implement the comments into the structure of the OO design. This lead to multiple issue in keeping track of how the logic design intertwined with the OO design. Additionally I failed to figure out how to change the Enumerated type to reflect the type of face card that was being showed.
